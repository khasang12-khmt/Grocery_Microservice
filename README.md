# Grocery_Online_Shopping_App
This is a practical example of NodeJS Microservices Architecture. We have built a simple Online Grocery Shopping Application using ES6 in a Monolithic way and segregated in Microservices Architecture without impact front end. So each individual service will work independently to serve the purpose and business logic.  You can watch its Youtube tutorial for better understanding and for Microservice you can code with me.
